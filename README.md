nodeJsCppBenchmark
==================
Benchmarking native JS in node against C++ code.

The benchmark does a bubble sort - inspired by this blog entry - https://jaxbot.me/articles/node-vs-go-2014

C++ code is running through FFI (https://github.com/node-ffi/node-ffi)

Results - I didn't get any substantial differences in performance.
